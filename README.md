for the course "multimediaprogrammering i python, 7.5p"


## game rules
you are the router,
route the correct datapacket to the correct cpu by translating the binary digit to the correct cpu with equal decimal number
for every right packet you get a point, at a certain number of points you can level up, which make the data packets generate faster
if you bring wrong packet to wrong cpu you lose all the points since the last level up
if you the buffer is filled with datapackets and consequently miss to send it, you will lose a healthpoint, miss three healthpoints and the game is over
